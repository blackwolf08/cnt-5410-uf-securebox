**Backend â€“**

After conducting an examination of the system implementation, I set up a JSP development environment in NetBeans and started developing various Java servlets for the necessary classes and functionalities. Later, I switched to the Eclipse IDE down the progress of the course.

**Frontend -**

Users of the system will only communicate with the frontend. It is mostly developed using HTML, JS, and CSS. For each user, we generated a JSP page, and we used Java Servlets to implement it.
